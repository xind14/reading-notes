#### Introduction
Hello everyone! My name is Xin Deng and here is the link to my [Github portfolio page!](https://github.com/xind14) The first assignment is to create my first project on Github and make a reading-notes repository after learning markdown for the first time. The different features I've used for this assignment are **heading, lists/nested list, styling: italics and bold, links, images, and emojis üòâ** I plan on putting all assignment instructions on here to keep a record because I have a bad memory so it'll be nice to have everything here.

#### What is a growth mind set and what are 3 reminders to myself to keep myself in a growth mindset?
A growth mindset is believing your intelligence and abilities can always improve and grow with an effort to learn and a determination to push through obstacles, which comes from running towards challenges as opportunities for growth. 
1. I do have a tendency to delay the start of something when I feel stuck, so I need to remind myself to walk away for a moment to calm the anxiety enough to feel motivated again to continue the task at hand.
2. I tend to also think the worst first and it overshadows the good, so I would like to start assessing aspects of my day or task I‚Äôm doing with what I did well on and what I can improve and learn from that criticism.
3. When I get overwhelmed I tend to start comparing myself to others who understand better than I do, but I need to remind myself that everyone started from somewhere and it‚Äôs not a race, but a journey of understanding that comes with failures and that's ok.

   - Hit enter after each command
   - **cd ..** is back one, . stay where you are, ... is back two directories
   - **code .** opens code editor. There is a space between code and .
   - When creating new directories do not use space either use no space or dashes ex: newFile or new-File. If you do mkdir my folder it will create two folders with those names
   - In VS Code: md should end with one line space, space after heading, emmet abbreviation are "universal" so by adding ! will give you choices and will automatically provide you the basic codes needed ex: !doctype gives you the code people almost always use in HTML

3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
   - **cd projects:** You change directory into the projects directory location.
   - **mkdir new-project:** You make a new directory titled new-project
   - **touch new-project/newfile.md:** You make a new markdown file within the new-project directory
