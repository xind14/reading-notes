## Answer

Statement on why this topic matter as it relates to what I'm studying in this module:

Adding on to what was learned in 201, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### Component-Based Architecture

1. What is a "component"?

    - A replaceable and reusable set of functionality. It is a software object, interacting with other components. Components are designed to be independent, allowing them to be deployed and composed individually.

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

    - Reusability: Designed to be reused in various applications or situations.
    - Replaceable: Can be substituted with similar components.
    - Not context specific: Operates effectively in diverse environments and contexts.
    - Extensible: Allows the addition of new functionalities through modification or extension.
    - Encapsulated: Hides internal complexities, exposing only a well-defined external interface.
    - Independent: Minimizes dependencies on other components.

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

    - Ease of deployment: Easy replacement of versions without disrupting other components.
    - Reduced cost: Third-party components use spreads the cost of development and maintenance.
    - Ease of development: Provides clear interfaces, promoting focused development without affecting the broader system.
    - Reusable: Reused across applications, leading to cost-effective development and maintenance.
    - Modification of technical complexity: Components manage complexity through specialized containers and services.
    - Reliability: The reliability of individual components contributes to the overall system's robustness through reuse.
    - System Maintenance and Evolution: Allows for easy updates and modifications.
    - Independent: Independent development and flexible connectivity, fostering productivity in software development.

### What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. What is “props” short for?
    - It is short for "properties." It is a special keyword used to pass data from one component to another.
2. How are props used in React?
    - They are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are objects and are passed to components like function arguments.
3. What is the flow of props?
    - The flow of props in React is unidirectional, meaning it goes from parent to child components. Data is passed from the parent component as props, and child components receive and use these props. Props are read-only, and modifications to them should be made in the parent component. Data from parent should not be changed by child components.


## Things I want to know more about

- How does React handle the communication of data between sibling components if it's unidirectional?
