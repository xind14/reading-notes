1. Basic express server:

   ```javaScript
   'use strict';

   // this library lets us access our .env file
   require('dotenv').config();

   // express is a server library
   const express = require('express');

   // initalizes the express library
   const app = express();

   // library that determines who is allowed to speak to our server
   const cors = require('cors');


   // this settting says that everyone is allowed to speak to our server
   app.use(cors());

   // we are getting the port variable from the .env file.
   const PORT = process.env.PORT;

   // this is a route. if you turn the server on and go to http://localhost:3001/ (or whatever port you specified in your .env), you will see 'hello from the home route'
   app.get('/', (request, response) => {
     response.send('hello from the home route');
   });

   // this turns the server on to the port that you specifed in your .env file
   app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`listening on ${PORT}`));
   ```

1. You can set up a route that your front-end can hit. Your server will return information on that route:

   ```javaScript
   // FRONT-END
   await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/cats');

   // BACK-END
   app.get('/cats', (request, response) => {
     response.send('cats are the best');
   });
   ```

1. You can also send information from the front-end to the back-end as a query.

   - Queries live in the URL after the question mark: `http://localhost:3000/?city=seattle`
   - To send that query to the back-end via axios, you could write code like:

     ```javaScript
     //FRONT-END
     await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/city', {params: { city: 'seattle' }});

     // BACK-END
     app.get('city', (request, response) => {
       const city = reqeust.query.city;
       response.send(`you sent the city of ${city}`)
     });
     ```

## Getting Started

### React App

1. Create a new React App with Vite `npm create vite@latest front-end`
1. Perform initial installation and add any dependencies
   - `npm install`
   - `npm install axios bootstrap react-bootstrap react-if`
1. Create a repository (front-end) at GitHub
1. Connect your React App to GitHub
   - git init
   - git branch -M main
   - git remote add origin (url to your repo, copied from gitHub)
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "initial commit"
   - git push origin main
1. Clear out all of the starter-code from the app and alter `App.jsx` to just render an `<h1>` with Hello World in it
1. Deploy your app to Netlify
1. Verify that you can see the starte app deployed at Netlify

### Express App

1. Create a new repository (back-end) at GitHub
   - Add a README
   - Choose the MIT license
   - Choose the "Node" .gitignore template
   - Make it "public"
   - Copy the URL
1. Clone this on your computer in a different folder from your react app
1. Create a file called server.js (`touch server.js`)
1. Initialize an NPM module
   - `npm init -y`
   - Install the basic dependencies for an express app
   - `npm install express cors dotenv axios mongoose`
1. Write a basic express server (use the above notes and demo as the basis)
1. Store the `PORT` in a file called `.env`
1. Deploy this to Render.com
1. Verify that you can see data coming from the `/` route once deployed

### Getting them to work together

1. Change your Express server's `/` route to return a JSON object. Something simple like:
   `{ message: "Hello" }`
1. Push to gitHub so that it deploys to render.com
1. Add a button to your React app that, when clicked, will do an async axios call to your server's `/` route
   - This will require that you put the URL to your server in the `.env.local` file and use that in the app to make the Axios call
   - We do this for security!
   - (This is shown in the demo)
1. When the data comes back, put it into state, and render that `message` in the `<h1 />`
1. Push to github so that it will deploy to netlify.com

At this point, you should be able to click a button and see the data from your server flowing to the front-end.

From this point, you can tailor the server and the react app together to accomplish ANY goal!






clone backend  (need to get mongo to connect)
npm install
npm test backend file
npm start (won't work so figure out why..... check json?)
npm start again and it should start




clone front end
npm install
npm test
npm run dev
