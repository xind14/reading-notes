# Class 5 - Images, Color, Text, and More Work with Functions

## Lab 5 - a: Fun with Functions, b: Finish the About Me project, c: CSS Selector Practice

## Setup

### 5a

> You are being given starter code for today, in the index.html and app.js files inside of this directory. The success of your code will be determined by whether it passes tests that are in the tests.js file. You do not need to do anything with tests.js, though you should take a look at it to see how it works.

- Steps to create your repo using the template:
  - Click the green Use this template button

  - Name your repo

  - Click the green Create repository from template button

- Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:
  - Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into main on GitHub (and then pull back into main on your laptop!) when the problem is completed. Do the problems in order. Don’t forget to pull the updated main branch from GitHub into your local main branch each time you merge a pull request, then make a new branch from main for the next problem.

  - Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.

### 5b

> Deploy your app to GitHub Pages and add any additional final touches to your CSS. Run a Lighthouse report making sure your site scores between the 50-65 range and add a screenshot of your score to your README.md. Make sure your app is complete and meets all of the requirements from the prior labs. Remove any commented out code or console logs including any commented out console logs that were used in the questionnaire.

## Learning Journal

Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

> “Adults need to know why to learn something; as soon as they answer this question, they are ready to start.”

The **why** applies to both large-scale (learning web development as a new profession) and small-scale (learning a particular tool or technique), and your learning journal is an excellent place to identify and contemplate those **whys**. They are important. So… what is your **why**?
