# Lab: Intro to Django

## Overview

The first words you see on the Django website are:

> Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.

The next quote you’ll see is:

> The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

In this class, we’ll build out a small, but functional, multi-page website using Django. We’ll get a feel for the “Django Way” and see the dramatic performance gains you can get with a mature, robust framework. Along the way, you’ll style your site in a new way using the utility-first framework TailwindCSS.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Create a website in Django with 2 pages:
  1. Home page
  2. About page
- Create views, URLs, and templates as needed for the home and about pages.
- Use an ancestor template to contain navigation elements.
- Should be built the “Django way” to match the structure of the in-class demo.
- Configure your project to use TailwindCSS/Flowbite. Just basic styling is sufficient for today, but stretch out if you’ve got time!

## Implementation Notes

### Typical Steps to Start Django Project

1. Create project.
2. Add dependencies if needed.
3. Define app.
4. Add app to project.
5. Add views.
6. Add urlpatterns.
7. Add templates.
8. Add tests.

### User Acceptance Tests

- Use Django’s built-in testing tools.
- Test that home and about URL status codes.
- Test home and about URL template use, including ancestor template.

## Configuration

- Create a Github repo named `django-snacks`.
- Create a Django project named `snacks_project`.
- Create a Django app named `snacks`.

Refer to Lab Submission Instructions for detailed instructions.

## Stretch Goals

- Create additional apps in the project.
- Pass additional info along to views and render it.
- Extend additional blocks in templates.
- Add dark mode to your site.
- Add Flowbite components.
