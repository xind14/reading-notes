# Practice with Chocolate Pizza

## Chocolate Pizza CSS

**If you are coming from a Code 201 class that ended within 2 weeks of the start of your Code 301 class**, submit the work you did there.

If you completed Code 201 more than 2 weeks prior to the start of Code 301, please complete this assignment as a way to keep your HTML/CSS skills sharp.

If you are testing in to Code 301, you should know that students in Code 201 complete a time-boxed “design comp” assignment, called “Chocolate Pizza”. This is your opportunity to take on that challenge:
    - Rather than the “complete as much of the assignment as you can in the available time” approach in Code 201, your challenge is to get the HTML/CSS mockup to be pixel-perfect
    - Your column of content should be centered in the window, as in the preview image
    - Your solution does not need to be responsive in any way
    - Do not use any negative margins, grids, or flex positioning
