# Lab: Django Custom User

## Overview

Django does a great job at allowing you to get started with a solid foundation. But a foundation is just the beginning. We still need to “build the house.” One of the first things many developers choose to do is to create a custom user model.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Create Django application `django-custom-user` from scratch that has a custom user model named `CustomUser`.
- Application should work with Django Admin.
- Use the very helpful tutorial at [LearnDjango](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model) (But check the Implementation Notes below about Django 5 tweak).

## Implementation Notes

- Make sure to create the custom user model before migrating data.
- WARNING: Django version 5 no longer supports logging out with a GET request. Refer to demo for safe logging out in Django 5.

## User Acceptance Tests

No acceptance tests required.

## Configuration

Refer to Lab Submission Instructions for detailed instructions.

## Stretch

- Create a Django application using [DjangoX](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox).
- Style form using [Django Widget Tweaks](https://prettyprinted.com/tutorials/django-widget-tweaks/).
