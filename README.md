#### Introduction
Hello everyone! My name is Xin Deng and here is the link to my [Github portfolio page!](https://github.com/xind14) The first assignment is to create my first project on Github and make a reading-notes repository after learning markdown for the first time. The different features I've used for this assignment are **heading, lists/nested list, styling: italics and bold, links, images, and emojis ðŸ˜‰** I plan on putting all assignment instructions on here to keep a record, but also I have bad memory so it'll be nice to have everything here.

#### What is a growth mind set and what are 3 reminders to myself to keep myself in a growth mindset?
A growth mindset is believing your intelligence and abilities can always improve and grow with an effort to learn and a determination to push through obstacles, which comes from running towards challenges as opportunities for growth. 
1. I do have a tendency to delay the start of something when I feel stuck, so I need to remind myself to walk away for a moment to calm the anxiety enough to feel motivated again to continue the task at hand.
2. I tend to also think the worst first and it overshadows the good, so I would like to start assessing aspects of my day or task Iâ€™m doing with what I did well on and what I can improve and learn from that criticism.
3. When I get overwhelmed I tend to start comparing myself to others who understand better than I do, but I need to remind myself that everyone started from somewhere and itâ€™s not a race, but a journey of understanding that comes with failures and that's ok.

#### Answer 
1. What is Markdown?
   - A lightweight markup language that allows you to add syntax to plaintext.
2. Why do we use Markdown?
   - Markdown can be used in everything like websites and books and can be found everywhere including big well known websites like reddit. It is useful because markdown files can be transferable and compatible across all operating systems and markdown applications and the format is readable without needing to preview the final product.
3. What symbol will create a heading in Markdown? How many do you need to create the largest heading? How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
   - The # is used to create headings. With 1 to create the largest and 6 to create the smallest.
5. When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
   - It is best practice to use asterisks. Two for bold and one for italics. 
6. How do you create a link with Markdown?
   - You put the link text of what you want to be clicked on in brackets and then put the URL in parentheses right after. So use [] and () with no space in between. 
8. What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
   - You can use a dash (-), a plus sign (+), or an asterisk (*).
