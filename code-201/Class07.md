# Class 7 - HTML Tables and JS Constructor Functions

## Lab 7 - Salmon Cookies Pt. 2

## Setup

1. Create a new branch for today’s lab. Make sure it has all of your changes from lab 06 so that you can extend the functionality.

2. Replace all of your object literals for the salmon cookie stand with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, it creates a new instance.

3. Replace the lists of your data for each store and build a single table of data instead. Break each column by the hour (6am - 7pm) and complete each row (Seattle, Tokyo, Dubai, Paris, Lima, Totals) with a “Daily Location Total”

4. Each cookie stand location should have a separate render() method that creates and appends its row to the table

5. The header row and footer row are each created in their own stand-alone function
    - NOTE: Please use a header cell for both the header row ( containing store hours ), and the footer row ( hourly and grand totals across all stores ).

6. Developer Style Guide: 
    - Good use of a constructor function; style and syntax are correctly implemented

    - Duplicate code has been removed and DRY principles are evident
    - Working on a non-main branch for the day, with regular commit history. Basically, every time you get something to work, you should do a commit. But you only need to push every couple of hours or so, tops.
