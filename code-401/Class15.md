# Class 15 - Trees, Job Search Workshop

## Lab 15 - None

## Setup

## Code Challenge

- **Branch Name:** trees
- **Challenge Type:** New Implementation

### Feature Tasks

1. **Node**
   - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

2. **Binary Tree**
   - Create a Binary Tree class
   - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
     - pre order
     - in order
     - post order
   - Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

3. **Binary Search Tree**
   - Create a Binary Search Tree class
   - This class should be a sub-class (or your language's equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
     - Add
       - Arguments: value
       - Return: nothing
       - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
     - Contains
       - Argument: value
       - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Answer

To turn in your reading “Reply” to this discussion by teaching something that you learned. Then review what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

- Use an analogy
- Explain a detail in depth
- Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
- Tutorial / walk through an example
- Write a quiz
- Create a vocabulary/definition list
- Write a cheat sheet
- Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
- Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
- Build a map of the information
- Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

### Vocabulary/Definition List for Linked Lists

1. **Trees:**

   - **Definition:** A hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has a value and references to other nodes.
   - **Analogy:** Think of a family tree where each person is a node, and relationships (edges) connect parents to children.

2. **Node:** A component in a tree containing values and references.
3. **Root:** The starting node of the tree.
4. **K** - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, `k = 2`.
5. **Left** - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
6. **Right** - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
7. **Leaf:** A node without any children.
8. **Edge:** The link between a parent and child node.
9. **Height:** The number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

10. **Traversals:**

    - **Definition:** The process of visiting nodes in a specific order.
    - **Analogy:** Navigating through a library by either exploring shelves from left to right (Breadth First) or going deep into each aisle (Depth First).

11. **Depth First:**

    - **Definition:** Traversal prioritizing the depth (height) of the tree first.
    - **Analogy:** Exploring a maze by choosing paths that go deeper before exploring other branches.

12. **Breadth First:**

    - **Definition:** Traversal iterating through each level of the tree.
    - **Analogy:** Searching a building floor by floor, covering all rooms on one level before moving to the next.

13. **Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees:**

    - **Definition:** Binary Tree restricts nodes to have at most two children, while K-ary Trees allow more than two.
    - **Analogy:** Binary is like a road intersection with only left and right turns, while K-ary is like an intersection allowing multiple directions.

14. **Binary Search Trees:**

    - **Definition:** A type of tree where values smaller than the root go left, and larger go right.
    - **Analogy:** Organizing a bookshelf where books with titles starting with A-L are on the left and M-Z are on the right.

15. **Searching a BST:**
    - **Definition:** Locating a specific value in a Binary Search Tree.
    - **Analogy:** Finding a word in a well-organized dictionary by comparing and narrowing down sections.

## Learning Journal

### Reflection

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
   - I liked learning the career stuff today, but I forgot to write most of it down so will rewatch recording later to take notes again.
2. What did I learn today?
   - No matter the skills you have most of your chances of getting hired is through networking, which I don't know how to do well so that's going to be such a challenge.
3. What should I do differently next time?
   - Take screenshots of the slides.
4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
   - I'm not understanding trees like I did stacks and queues so I will look at it more.
5. Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:
   - Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
     - Assignments are complete. Will work on readings for next week.
