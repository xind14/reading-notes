### Reflection

Take 10-15 minutes at the end of lab to respond to the following questions, adapted from the article:

1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
   - I am good at project management things. Tammy gave me a list of job position titles to look up so I will be doing that this weekend.
2. What did I learn today?
   - Our set up was pretty fast and I will learn more about playwright tonight.
3. What should I do differently next time?
   - Nothing today. It was pretty smooth, we got all of our prep work done pretty quick and decided on task assignments already.
4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
   - Playwright because it's definitely a new thing we need to learn for this project
5. Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:
   - Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
     - Assignments are complete. Will work on readings for next next week and playwright research.

> Communication Under Stress - Eve Denison

1. Share one or two ways the speaker’s information will change your approach to your career transition.

   - If you’re already bracing yourself for things to go badly, you project an energy that’s not going to be effective in conversation. I do this a lot because I tend to see things realistically and I guess there’s a fine line between realistic and pessimistic.
   - It's acceptable to teach others how to communicate with you effectively, for example “If you need feedback, I respond well like this…” Really good advice, but remember to teach in an effective way too.

1. List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

   - Strong emotions put different parts of your brain in the driver seat trying to get different things you want.
   - Assumptions pose a significant obstacle to effective communication.
   - In writing, there's a risk of losing much in translation, leading to ineffective communication.
   - Acknowledge personal triggers from life, as they accompany us to work and school, impacting interactions.
   - Regularly check your general well-being; it's acceptable to have a bad day, but it's often neglected due to busyness.
   - If you’re already bracing yourself for things to go badly, you project an energy that’s not going to be effective in conversation
   - Differentiate between not getting what you want and not being heard to avoid confusion.
   - When stressed in communication, take a pause to ensure you respond from a non-reactive part of the brain.
   - Assess the urgency before responding immediately; not every situation requires an immediate reply.
   - Utilize the "and over but" technique to acknowledge achievements and consider additional steps.
   - It's acceptable to teach others how to communicate with you effectively, for example “If you need feedback, I respond well like this…”

1. Share a screenshot of your LinkedIn connection request, including a nicely worded note, sent to the speaker or someone else at their company.
