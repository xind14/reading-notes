## Submission Instructions

Submit your thoughts on these prompts in the assignmentâ€™s text field in Canvas.

1. List any features of Python that you like/dislike most so far.

   - Likes:
     - Readability: syntax is clear and readable
     - Libraries: built in libraries
   - Dislikes:
   - Global Scope by Default: need to handle carefully.
   - Mostly used for backend which I would like to work on front-end

2. List some of the ways that Python is similar and different from JavaScript.

   - Similarities

     - Object-oriented: can define a class, create properties that add to the class, and then create an object that contains classes.
     - Both use functions and variables

   - Differences
     - Syntax: Python uses indentation for code structure, while JavaScript uses curly braces and semicolons.
     - Package Management: Python uses tools like pip for package management, while JavaScript uses npm (Node Package Manager) for managing packages.
     - Use Cases: Python is often used for a broader range of applications, including data science, machine learning, and backend development, while JavaScript is primarily used for front-end web development.
