# Overview

This `reading-notes` repository will contain all my notes and assignments for the entirety of the Code Fellows program. I've taken 102, and will start 201 on October 23rd, 2023! This page as well as others will be updated as the program goes on.

The general layout of my notes will be: 

- A table of contents linked to a `READ.md` file for each class
- A table of contents under the heading for each class broken down into the individual topics of each lecture days
- Within each lecture day file there will be all or most of the following depending on the class: 

  - The `Lab` section that includes the setup instructions and links to any additional resources

  - A `Written Class Notes` section for things discussed in lectures
  
  - A `Reading` section with links to the resources for the reading assignments, additional responses to the questions of the assignment, and a things I would like to know more about section

  - A `Career` section with the assignment instructions

  - A  `Learning Journal` reflection entry

## Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Xin Deng and here is the link to my [Github portfolio page!](https://github.com/xind14) The first assignment for this program is to create my first project on Github and make a reading-notes repository after learning markdown for the first time. I plan on putting all assignment instructions on here to keep a record because I have a bad memory so it'll be nice to have everything here. The different features I've used for this assignment are **heading, lists/nested list, styling: italics and bold, links, images, and emojis ðŸ˜‰** You can check it out here in my [Class 01 section](code-102/Class01.md) and also make sure to check out my progress in other classes by utilizing the **Table of Contents** below.
