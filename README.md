#### Introduction
Hello everyone! My name is Xin Deng and here is the link to my [Github portfolio page!](https://github.com/xind14) The first assignment is to create my first project on Github and make a reading-notes repository after learning markdown for the first time. The different features I've used for this assignment are **heading, lists/nested list, styling: italics and bold, links, images, and emojis ðŸ˜‰** 

#### What is a growth mind set and what are 3 reminders to myself to keep myself in a growth mindset?
A growth mindset is believing your intelligence and abilities can always improve and grow with an effort to learn and a determination to push through obstacles, which comes from running towards challenges as opportunities for growth. 
1. I do have a tendency to delay the start of something when I feel stuck, so I need to remind myself to walk away for a moment to calm the anxiety enough to feel motivated again to continue the task at hand.
2. I tend to also think the worst first and it overshadows the good, so I would like to start assessing aspects of my day or task Iâ€™m doing with what I did well on and what I can improve and learn from that criticism.
3. When I get overwhelmed I tend to start comparing myself to others who understand better than I do, but I need to remind myself that everyone started from somewhere and itâ€™s not a race, but a journey of understanding that comes with failures and that's ok.
