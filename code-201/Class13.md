# Class 13 - Introduction to Persistence with Local Storage

## Lab 13 - Odd Duck Products and Data Persistence

## Setup

1. As a user, I would like my data to persistently track totals between page refreshes, so that I can keep track of the aggregate number of votes.

    - Implement local storage into your current application

    - Make sure the data persists across both browser refreshes and resets

    - Hints:
        - Store the products array into local storage as a formatted JSON string

        - Retrieve the products array from local storage and then utilize the `JSON.Parse()` function. Remember, if your constructor utilizes `prototype` methods, you will have to send each item in the array back through the constructor function.

2. Run a Lighthouse Accessability report. Make necessary updates to your application based on the report to get your score above 80.

    - Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md file.
