## Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Xin Deng and here is the link to my [Github portfolio page!](https://github.com/xind14) The first assignment for this program is to create my first project on Github and make a reading-notes repository after learning markdown for the first time. I plan on putting all assignment instructions on here to keep a record because I have a bad memory so it'll be nice to have everything here. The different features I've used for this assignment are **heading, lists/nested list, styling: italics and bold, links, images, and emojis ðŸ˜‰** You can check it out here in my [Class 01 section](code-102/Class01.md) and also make sure to check out my progress in other classes by utilizing the **Table of Contents** below.
