# Update Your Resume

## Resume: Update your Projects

Update the Projects and Technical Skills section of your school-provided resume. This will one day potentially be shared with our hiring partners. Your resume template was created in conjunction with industry leaders to highlight the skills and projects you have developed.

During each course you will have assignments that will guide you in updating each section of the resume. Work only on the section specified by the assignments.

Remember the following:

1. Changes to your resume should be made directly in the Google Doc provided.
2. Edits to your resume should be in verbiage only. Do NOT alter the format, layout, font, bullets, spacing, coloring, etc.
3. By the time you graduate your resume should match this [Resume Model](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JlbA8PBqRfC_Nj4hpyduIlPUar8YjT-GzgvSCaojojA/edit) with your tech skills and story highlighted.

Working in the tech industry requires a sharp eye for detail. Your resume needs to meet industry expectations of a professional and be ready to share with potential employers. An impeccable resume will be your first opportunity to showcase to a hiring manager your attention to detail.
