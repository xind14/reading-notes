# Explore Behavioral Interview Questions

## Behavioral Interview Prep

Preparing for your behavioral questions early is a MUST because you WILL be asked these types of questions in the interview process. Preparing now is a vital step in becoming the lead candidate for the role. Your answers need development and curation time. The more you practice and receive feedback the better you sound when sharing your experiences.

## Highlight Positive Results

Behavioral questions that involve tension situations (e.g. tell me a time when you worked with someone difficult, when did you make a mistake, or when did you disagree) should always have a good outcome. Never tell a story about an experience where you leave the interviewer thinking that someone was marginalized by you or a group. Instead, you want the interviewer to know that you handled a difficult situation and everyone lived happily ever after. Luckily, you get to choose the situation you will talk about!

## Assignment

If you havenâ€™t already, create your own collection of answers to common behavioral questions by making a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u02dYTGk9F8eVi59HABVF2HP_ksNW1svfKMZ8nuYkmk/).

Write out responses to 3 additional behavioral questions from [this list](https://theinterviewguys.com/behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers-101/). You should now have developed 6 responses to behavioral questions in total, as part of your interview prep. If you tested into this course, please answer six questions.

Remember to answer in the [S.T.A.R. format](https://careerservices.wayne.edu/pdf/behavioralinterviewinfo.pdf), which is the expectation standard.

Have your two accountability partners review your answers. After you make your edits based on feedback, share your written answers by copying them out of your document and pasting them in the class discussion.
