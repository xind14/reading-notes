## Answer

Statement on why this topic matter as it relates to what I'm studying in this module:

Adding on to what was learned in 201, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.


## Reading Questions

1. Describe the types of automation in Python to automate everyday tasks. What are some possible applications of this knowledge in the real-world context?

2. What is monkey patching in Python? Discuss its benefits and potential risks. Provide an example where monkey patching can be beneficial.

3. How can you use Pytest and its Capsys fixture to test printed output in Python? Can you describe a situation where this technique would be particularly useful?



## Things I want to know more about

- How does React handle the communication of data between sibling components if it's unidirectional?

### Reflection

Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

Motivation and goals are an important part of adult learning; so is adapting to and gaining insight from things you did not anticipate. What would you say is the most unexpected part of this experience, and how have you learned from it?

- The most unexpected part so far is that I was never prepared for the intensity of this even after each class in this program. I knew though a few months to learn coding was already too short because there is just so much to learn, and I knew it was an intensive bootcamp, but I still am not ready and feel like a fish out of water. There is just so much homework that I don't have time for myself sometimes which is fine. I now know that I might need more learning after this possibly and I don't mind. I found free courses for JS/React that I'm excited to refresh myself on and free sources for Python for refreshers after the program as well.
