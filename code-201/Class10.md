# Class 10 - Debugging and Error Handling

## Lab 10 - a: Build a Single Webpage in 4 hours, b: Salmon Cookies Pt. 5

## Setup

### 10a

> In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we’ve been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch. You only have 4 hours to complete this assignment. It is your job to create a page that looks exactly like the preview below. Within your GitHub class repo, under today’s directory, you will find all of the assets required to accomplish this task in addition to a larger version of this preview image.

![Lab 10 Website We Need to Duplicate](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-10/lab-a/lab-assets/PREVIEW.jpg)

1. Create a new repository for today called **chocolate-pizza**. If partnered for this lab, follow the pair programming work flow by having one user fork the other so that you can get some practice in your Git processes. Be sure to do frequent commits, and always do your work on branches. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching this project. Before writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work:
    - When should you focus on styling?

    - When should you make a decision about a layout scheme?

    - When should you just build out the structure of the HTML?

    - When you should you add JS? Do you even add JS?

2. Suggestion: Set up your work directory like this:

    - `index.html`

    - `style.css`

    - `app.js or script.js` (if you choose to use JS)

    - `img/` (a directory that contains all of your image assets)

### 10b

> Finish up your Salmon Cookies project. Ensure that you meet all minimum functionality described in prior labs as well as successfully implemented all of the requirements for the `index.html` file listed in Lab 06. Here they are, listed below:

  1. A custom Google font for highlights

  2. A specified standard sans-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)

  3. A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)

  4. Specified different font colors for all three font usages

  5. A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)

  6. A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)

  7. Anything else you’d like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.

  8. Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.

  9. Run a Lighthouse Accessibility report looking for a score between 65-80. Make adjustments to site as needed to get to that score. Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md.

  10. Include all of the typical stuff that you’ll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, phone number, email address, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.

## Written Class Notes

### Describe and Define

- Response design principles
- Software execution call stack

### Notes

1. What are a few ways we can debug our code?

2. What are some of the error types you may encounter in the console?

### Major Browsers' Debugging Tools

**Keyboard**: macOS: `command` + `option` + `i`
**Chrome**: menu, more tools, developer tools, console
