### Requirements

1. Add validation on one of the user inputs.
    - Keep asking until an acceptable value is entered.

    - Prompt the user with a relevant question for a number (e.g.: “How many cats do you want?” or “What star rating would you give, 1-5?”)
    - Use a loop in your JavaScript code to show the image that many times.
    - How could you use functions to make your code more readable?
