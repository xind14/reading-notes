Challenges

1. Navigate to the javascript folder within your data-structures-and-algorithms repository.
2. Create a new branch for this challenge called for-each
   git checkout -b for-each
3. Retrieve the code challenge from the system
   npm run get-challenge 01
4. In your terminal, from the javascript folder, run npm test 01 to execute the tests in this file for this challenge.
5. At this point you will see the failed tests scroll through your terminal window with a brief report of the number of failed tests at the bottom.
6. If you do not see this, verify your installation of Jest by typing npx jest --version in your terminal. Filename typos can make things break!
7. Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
8. Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.
9. Note, you can also run npm test (without a challenge number) to run all of the tests for every code challenge file assignment during the course all at once. This can get “noisy”, but it’s an opportunity to get a view of your overall progress

Submission
When you have completed the entire set of code challenges and all tests pass, create a pull request from your current branch to the main branch and merge it into main.

You will be able to see a test coverage report in GitHub on the Actions tab of your data-structures-and-algorithms repository. It should match what you saw on your terminal in the above steps. Your graders will be looking at this as well.

Submit a link to your pull request.

## Answer

Statement on why this topic matter as it relates to what I'm studying in this module:

Adding on to what was learned in 201, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developer’s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?


## Things I want to know more about

- How does React handle the communication of data between sibling components if it's unidirectional?

## Retrospective

Retrospectives are a critical part of Agile, and typically take the form of meetings held by a team at the end of a sprint cycle. To get us acclimated to that process, we will use the format of a retrospectives to guide today’s reflection.

This [article](https://www.benlinders.com/2013/which-questions-do-you-ask-in-retrospectives/) gives a nice overview to the role of retrospectives.

1. What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?
2. What did I learn today?
3. What should I do differently next time?
4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
5. Thinking about each of your assignments for the day, reflect on:
   - Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
   - Do not get bogged down in written analysis; instead, focus on capturing the moment with an eye toward how your observations can guide you toward future productivity.
