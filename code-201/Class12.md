# Class 12 - Canvas and ChartJS

## Lab 12 - Odd Duck Products Pt. 2

## Setup

> Below are your lab requirements in a user story format. Try and think up what the feature tasks would be for each story, once you are done, or you get stuck, review the provided feature tasks to see what the actual tasks are for each story.

1. Do today’s work on a branch called dataviz.

2. As a marketeer, I want to prevent users from seeing the same image in two subsequent iterations, so that they are not biased.

    - Update your algorithm to randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory.

    - Update your algorithm so that new products are generated, confirm that these products are not duplicates from the immediate previous set.

3. As a marketing manager, I would like a visual representation of how many times a product was clicked so that I can visually analyze the results.

    - Using ChartJS (imported from CDN), display the vote totals and the number of times a product was viewed in a bar chart format. (hint: don’t forget about the `<canvas>` tags)

    - Place the bar chart in the section located beneath your three product images

    - The bar charts should only appear after all voting data has been collected.

4. Run a Lighthouse Accessability report. Make necessary updates to your application based on the report to get your score above 80.

    - Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md file.

## Career 12 - Resume Review By Your Accountability Partners

> Once your resume matches our guideline outlined here, have your accountability partners review your resume and give you feedback on how well it matches the guideline. Make a copy of your resume and send it to your accountablity partner for suggested edits. Intergrate those suggested changes onto your orginal resume and then DELETE the copy.

- A note on feedback: Whenever possible, provide a balance of positive and negative feedback. If you consistently give only positive or negative feedback, people will distrust the feedback and it will become useless. Remember to highlight what you liked on their resumes while also sharing ways for them to improve.

> Also, remember to make ALL changes in the original resume document emailed to you when you enrolled, to be sure you are updating the official file that is in our database—this file is what we will be sharing with partner companies once it is approved by your Instructor in 401.
